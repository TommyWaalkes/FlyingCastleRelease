    <p>Instructions: Retake your base from all the enemies, while keeping the yellow pod alive, which contains the last
        known humans</p>
    <p>Bars at the top:</p>
    <p>Yellow - this is the health of the humans</p>
    <p>Green - this is your health</p>
    <p>Red - this gauges how many enemies are present in your castle</p>
    <p>Controls: WASD or Arrow keys for movement, W and S or Up and Down arrows to climb on ladders (light brown
        rectangles) </p>
    <p>Space to jump</p>
    <p>E or X to shoot, and you can do a charge shot if you hold them down</p>
    <p>Z or Q will let you open doors</p>
    <p>G or C will throw grenades if you have them</p>
    <p>F or V will throw portal grenades which teleport the player, if you have them</p>
    <p>On death you will be teleported back to the starting pod to heal and will be stunned while you do so</p>
    <p>R will teleport you back to the starting point. Collisions are wacky so use this if you get lodged into a wall.
